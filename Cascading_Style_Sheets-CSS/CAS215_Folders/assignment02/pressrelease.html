<h1> WidgetCo Inc. Posts Record Profits in 3Q 1999</h1> 

<h2>Industry Leader Credits Hard Work, Determination, Licensing Fees as Keys to its 
Success</h2> 

<p>In its best performance since the company was founded in 1993, <span 
class="company-name">WidgetCo Inc.</span> announced that its third-quarter profits for 1999 
totalled $217 million. "This only points to the continuing strength of <span 
class="company-name">WidgetCo</span> and its wonderful, hardworking employees," said 
John X. Corphead, CEO and Chairman of the Board. "With a workforce this dedicated, I have 
every confidence that our fourth-quarter earnings will be equally impressive. I continue to be as 
proud as a new father of our company and its incredible products."</p> 

<p>A pioneer in the fast-growing field of widget mass production and distribution, <span 
class="company-name">WidgetCo</span> has introduced several new products over the last 
twelve months, including the industrial-strength Fusion Widget, the highly popular Farming 
Widget, and media darling Plaid Widget. <span class="company-name">WidgetCo</span> also 
holds the patents on several key widget technologies, including the industry-standard Parallel 
Widget Extruder C2100, and its reasonable licensing fees to other players in the 
widget-production industry has enabled it to remain a leader in this field. A corporate 
restructuring and workforce-reduction initiative early in 1999 has helped boost profits to their 
current record levels, according to Corphead. "By streamlining our workflow, we've made 
ourselves more flexible and adaptable, which is a necessity as we bring this company into the 
21st century," Corphead says.</p> 

<p id="summary"><span class="company-name">WidgetCo</span> is a publicly traded 
company (NYSE: <a href="http://www.nyse.sm/show_stock.cgi?WIDGTCO" 
class="stockinfo">WIDGTCO</a>; NASDAQ: <a 
href="http://www.nasdaq.sm/list/tech/wdgtmkr/" class="stockinfo">WDGTMKR</a>) with 
corporate, industrial, and retail customers throughout the world. Since its founding in 1993, 
WidgetCo's company mission has been to create the best, most useful widgets on the market and
