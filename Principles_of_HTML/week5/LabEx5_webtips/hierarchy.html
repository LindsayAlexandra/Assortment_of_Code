      <h3>You Are in Control</h3>
      <p>Visual design should be all about communication, but it often isn't. It is 
        not about using the latest and most trendy font. It is not about adding bells 
        and whistles to your site. It is about communicating and using visual design 
        to help you do this.</p>
      <h3>What Is Your Goal? Your Visitor's Goal?</h3>
      <p>In order to create hierarchy, you must first determine the hierarchy of your 
        information. What is your site trying to accomplish? Selling something? Would 
        the visitor want to buy something? If so, make your store the first read, and 
        make purchasing goods easy and intuitive.</p>
      <h3>First Read, Second Read, Third Read</h3>
      <p>Once you know what you want to do, think about your site design as a series 
        of &quot;reads.&quot; Use visual devices to achieve hierarchy, such as: color, 
        typography, scale, animation, sound, and interactivity.</p>
