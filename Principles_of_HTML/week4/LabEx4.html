<h2>Things to Remember</h2> 

<p>You must remember my birthday, March 21<sup>st</sup>! Beyond that, try thinking about ways to give text <em>emphasis</em> or <var>contrast</var> or &nbsp;visual space.</p><br> 

<p>Keep in mind this quote from the writer <cite>Virginia DeBolt</cite>:</p>

<blockquote>CSS allows effective techniques to make large areas of text on the Web more reader friendly. Readability and appearance are affected by line length, line height, white space, font choice and other formatting. CSS also is useful for grouping material into organized content blocks that can be given semantic and visual distinction to make the text easier to read and use.</blockquote>

<p>It isn't enough to remember my birthday. You should also remember what I like. I like mysteries and I like <abbr>Alaska</abbr>. That's why I read books like Blindfold Game by <cite>Dana Stabenow</cite>. You get both things: <abbr>Alaska</abbr> and mystery. The official Dana Stabenow web site is at <a href="http://www.stabenow.com">stabenow.com</a>.</p>

<h2>What Do You Remember?</h2> 
<p>Okay, enough about me. What do you remember? Do you remember your first address? (Mine was 402 S. 7<sup>th</sup> St.) Do you remember what C<small>O</small>2 is?</p>
