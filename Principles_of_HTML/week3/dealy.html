  <p>I am currently pursuing an Associate’s Degree in Web Site Development and Design, and possibly a certificate in multimedia. I am looking forward to attending Northwest College of Art and Design in Poulsbo, Washington or Platt College in San Diego, California where I will obtain my Bachelor of Science in Web Media Arts. I am also currently pursuing my interest in grant writing for non-profits.
    My educational goals support my very ambitious career goals in many different ways. I am involved in the Portland Chapter of Code Scouts, a support network for women going into the IT field. I am interested in multimedia work, specifically animation. I have been influenced greatly by Tim Burton. The animation in movies like “Frankenweenie” and “The Nightmare Before Christmas” have always intrigued me. And I have also noticed that there is not a strong representation of women in the animation field. I would like to change that for those who follow in my footsteps. A project that I would like to take on after I complete my education is to develop a program specifically in the animation and web development design field for women.</p>
