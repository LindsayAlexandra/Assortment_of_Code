<h1>Lab 9</h1>
<p>A tip that I found interesting was number 5 from<strong><em>sitepoint.com</em></strong>.  In this tip content was greatly emphasized.  Content that contains the keywords that are related to the website will increase the ranking profile on Google and other search engines.  The content may come in the form of a news article, reports, even links to external websites.  When designing a website the keywords need to be both significant and also not overly popular.  <br>
<br>
I honestly found the <strong><em>digital-web.com</em></strong> site to be the most useful.  The reason for this is because it lists several reasons as to why a designer wants to have separate style sheets.  Java and CSS internal style sheets prevent the web crawler from locating the relevant keywords in the content of the site.  Not just for the sake of organization.  But I personally feel that it keeps the construction of the website a lot cleaner and running smoother if the style sheets are external. <br>
<br>
And finally <strong><em>SEO-writer.com</em></strong> I am looking forward to trying out the Socialfloat and the Bookmarketer.  But the tip that I was interested in the most was the deep linking  to other websites.  Not just one page in the website.  As links to other websites much as possible through the entire website.  I find this very appealing because of the how Wordpress sights are ranked and the relationship with social networking sights that you find on every Wordpress sight.  On mine I have my Twitter feed, Facebook and even a few others and my Wordpress sights rank fairly high.</p>
