  <h1>Project Update 1</h1>
  <h2>Project Proposal</h2>
  <p>My project is going to be a vintage clothing website.  I my target audience is going to be people that are interested in vintage fashion or are involved in the sub-culture.  I have found that a lot of the vintage clothing websites are not always the most appealing and very cluttered.  My goal with this project in mind is to design and build a website that has a vintage feel, un cluttered and very appealing to the customer.  I will be using different pictures of vintage fashion as well as implementing colors of the classic vintage style.  I will have to do research on the vintage sub-culture and fashion to accomplish this project successfully.</p>
