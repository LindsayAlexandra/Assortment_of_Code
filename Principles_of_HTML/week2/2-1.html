<h1>Fixed Layout </h1>
<h2>From <em> Professional CSS Cascading Style Sheets for Web Design,</em> pages 23-25 </h2>
<p>A fixed (or "ice") layout is one whose width is constant and unchanging. No matter how large or small the user's browser window becomes, 
the actual width of the page's content will remain, well, fixed. The benefit to this approach is that it lends ultimate control to the designer, who 
always knows the dimensions of the canvas he or she is designing upon. For professionals coming from a print background, this approach is a rather 
intuitive one. If the width of the content area is a fixed constant, then a designer can hang perfectly sized graphics upon that canvas with 
pixel-prefect precision.</p>

<p>However, the success of a fixed-width design is contingent upon an assumption: namely, the designer's assumption of the width of the user's browser 
window. Should the browser's width ever become narrower than that of the page, then a horizontal scroll bar will appear, forcing the user to manually 
scroll the page from left to right to see the site as its designer intended.</p>

<p>Conversely, fixed-width designs are often unkind to larger screen resolutions. When browsing at higher resolutions and with a fully maximized window, a
 design optimized for smaller window sizes can be drowned out by unused white space. Our users' displays are constantly increasing, which makes 
 fixed-width designs less than future-proof--a site designed for the resolutions of today will likely need to be revisited in a year or two, as its users
 clamor for a more intelligent use of the window widths available to them.</p>
