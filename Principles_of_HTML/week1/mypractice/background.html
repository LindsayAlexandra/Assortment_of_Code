<h2>My Background</h2>
<p>I am currently pursuing an Associateâ€™s Degree in Web Site Development and Design, and possibly a 
certificate in multimedia. I am looking forward to attending Northwest College of Art and Design in 
Poulsbo, Washington or Platt College in San Diego, California where I will obtain my Bachelor of Science in 
Web Media Arts. I am also currently pursuing my interest in grant writing for non-profits.</p>
