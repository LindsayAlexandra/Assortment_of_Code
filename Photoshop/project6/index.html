    <td><p>I resized the image making it 200px larger in both dimensions.  Image transformed to flip horizontal to get the cake in the direction that I wanted it in.  I made the selection and feathered it by 2px.  I then transferred and adjusted the size of the selection and even rotated the selection to give it a tilt look.  Drop shadow, inner shadow and outer shadow layer effects were applied to the selection. A layer of text was then applied making the text bulge, changing color and size adjustments.  Stroke, outer shadow layer effects were applied to the text layer.  Then I adjusted the image curve in the backdrop layer.</p>  </td>

    <td><p>I resized the backdrop by increasing the dimensions by 200 px.  I made my selection then feathered it at 2px.  I then moved my selection to the backdrop and adjusted the size and angle before deselecting.  I applied drop shadow layer effects to the selection layer.   I adjusted the curve to hide the counter top look then added the text layer changing the size, color and font.  The outer glow layer effect (in green) was added to make the red text stand out.</p>  </td>

Transferred the selection to the backdrop layer and adjusted the size of the selection.  Outer glow and inner glow layer effects were applied.  I applied distort diffuse glow filter to the backdrop layer and adjusted the curves.  I then added a layer of text in bright yellow applying stroke, drop shadow and outer glow layer effects.</p></td>
